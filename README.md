# Sales

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

============ Create Angular App ====================================
explain how the angular app runs
How an Angular application runs
When you launch an Angular application, a series of steps unfold behind the scenes to bring it to life in your browser. This process is commonly known as bootstrapping. 
Here's a breakdown of how it works:
1. Initial loading and compilation
The web browser first loads the index.html file, which is the application's entry point.
This HTML file references various JavaScript bundles generated by the Angular CLI during the build process.
These bundles contain the compiled application code, Angular core libraries, third-party libraries, and polyfills for browser compatibility.
Angular applications are written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript. Before running, this TypeScript code needs to be compiled into standard JavaScript that browsers understand.
The compilation can happen in two ways:
Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation: The application is compiled in the browser at runtime. This is the default for development, as it allows for quicker iterations and easier debugging.
Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation: The application is compiled during the build process before the code is deployed. This leads to faster startup times, smaller bundle sizes, and enhanced security, making it the preferred choice for production environments.  
2. Bootstrapping the root module
The angular.json file, the main configuration file, specifies the entry point for the application, typically main.ts.
The main.ts file imports and bootstraps the application's root module, usually named AppModule.
The AppModule is adorned with the @NgModule decorator, which defines metadata about the module, including declarations (components, directives, pipes), imports (other modules), providers (services), and the bootstrap property. 
3. Launching the root component
The bootstrap property within the @NgModule decorator specifies the root component to be loaded when the application starts, often named AppComponent.
The AppComponent is itself a class adorned with the @Component decorator, which provides metadata such as:
selector: The custom HTML tag where the component's template will be rendered (e.g., <app-root>).
templateUrl: The path to the component's HTML template file.
styleUrls: The paths to the component's CSS style files.
Angular identifies the selector in the index.html file and inserts the compiled AppComponent's template and styles into the designated location. 
4. Change detection and lifecycle
Angular's Change Detection mechanism monitors the application's data for changes and automatically updates the view to reflect those changes.
This mechanism is triggered by various events, including user interactions (clicks, input), HTTP requests, and asynchronous JavaScript functions (e.g., setTimeout).
Angular traverses the component tree from top to bottom, checking for changes in component properties and updating the DOM where necessary.
Developers can customize the change detection strategy (e.g., using the OnPush strategy) to optimize performance for large applications by specifying when components should be checked for changes. 
5. Dependency injection
Angular uses Dependency Injection (DI) as a design pattern to provide components and services with their dependencies rather than having them create those dependencies themselves.
This fosters loose coupling between components, making the code more modular, testable, and reusable.
Services, which encapsulate business logic and data access, are typically made available to components via dependency injection, allowing components to focus on UI concerns. 
By following these steps, Angular efficiently compiles, bootstraps, renders, and manages your web application, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience.

======================Angular material======================================================
npm install @angular/material --legacy-peer-deps

====================Modules========================================

1. Project setup
Create a new Angular project: ng new lazy-loading-demo --routing.
Navigate into the project directory: cd lazy-loading-demo. 
2. Generate feature modules
Create a Products Module with routing: ng generate module products --routing.
Create two components within the Products Module: ng generate component products/product-list, ng generate component products/product-detail.
Create an Orders Module with routing: ng generate module orders --routing.
Create a component within the Orders Module: ng generate component orders/order-list. 
3. Configure routing
Main application routing (src/app/app-routing.module.ts)
Configure lazy loading for the feature modules: 
Configure the main application routing (src/app/app-routing.module.ts) to use lazy loading for the products and orders paths, and redirect the root path to /products. For a more detailed look at the code, refer to the provided document. 
Next, define the child routes for the Products module in src/app/products/products-routing.module.ts. This includes a default route for the list component and a route with a parameter for the detail component. The Orders module routing (src/app/orders/orders-routing.module.ts) should define the child route for the Order List component. 
In the AppComponent template (src/app/app.component.html), add navigation links for "Products" and "Orders" and include the <router-outlet> to display the routed components. 
To verify lazy loading, run the application with ng serve and open your browser's Developer Tools, specifically the Network tab. Observe that initially, only the main application bundles are loaded. When you navigate to the "Products" or "Orders" links, new JavaScript chunks should be downloaded in the Network tab, confirming lazy loading. Revisiting a route will not re-download the chunk. 
Common debugging steps for lazy loading issues include checking for incorrect paths in loadChildren, ensuring modules export necessary components, and avoiding accidental imports of lazy-loaded modules into eagerly loaded ones. Use the browser's Network tab for 404 errors and the Console for JavaScript errors. AOT compilation and tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer can assist in identifying problems early and understanding bundle composition. 
Implementing lazy loading and utilizing these debugging techniques can improve your Angular application's performance.
